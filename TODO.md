- [X] make a game simulation with Nature player

- [X] make a functional prototype of the game using wasd and enter

- scrapped - generate all winning configurations ie brute-force all of the positions with a set goal and under
  - [X] generate all configurations with only winning tiles and empty tiles
- generate all final-time configurations

- [x] set up a simple version of the Bellman equation algorithm

- [x] go through actions states and then nature states if it's faster

- [x] check what happens for empty state
